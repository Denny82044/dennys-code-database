Notes:
holy...

note: player 1 has to get over a certain amount of A presses for it to work. This number is currently not known.

second note: this probably wont work if other players get the 160 max. Also, this code doesn't support UnclePunch's 300 uncapped code.

third and final note: this hasn't been tested on real hardware, but is very much expected to crash.

Code:
