# Denny's Code Database
This repository contains all of my published cheat codes.

I mainly make cheat codes for Wii and GameCube, but sometimes i like to try something different.

Do note that most of my codes have not been tested in normal gameplay, only in the environment where they take effect, so, they may cause some bugs and glitches. If you manage to find any, please report them to me on Discord (denny82044), or by making a GitHub issue thread on this repo.
